(https://brandvibesmedia.github.io/homedepot/)https://brandvibesmedia.github.io/homedepot/

# Next Steps: 
- Saving user choice of currencies in cookies to show those currencies in one's next visit
- Possibly saving history data to show how the currencies perform related to each other. Also some kind of chart can be implemented
- Caching the currency values and updating them once/twice a day using Cron or similar 
- Adding more currencies and implement autocomplete input instead of select
- Allowing user to type in "toAmount" input the amount they want to get. In this case, "fromAmount" will be calculated.
